# Advent of Code

My solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz). Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at midnight (EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!

## AoC 2023 Progress

Apparently AoC and wedding planning don't go well together. :smile:

## AoC 2022 Progress

2022 was arguably an improvement from any previous years since I managed to get many sub-1000 rankings, but at the end of the day I feel pretty bad that I met my end at part 2 of day 17. The difficulty definitely went up exponentially between day 15 and day 16, so I feel happy I was able to do day 16 at least. Nevertheless, day 17's part 2 was a challenge I felt would take too long to bare for me, and as per my tradition, I decidedly ended up stopping AoC for the rest of the year due to failing to complete a part in time before the next day.

Note: I did day 15 about 1.5 hours later.

## AoC 2021 Progress

2021 was a more productive AoC year. I managed to get to day 17, and then, after trying day 18 for many, many hours, eventually failed at completing it and therefore did not complete AoC 2021.

## AoC 2020 Progress

2020 was a quite the challenge for my schedule. I started working at a COVID-19 lab in November and had very taxing hours. There were some days I did the AoC at work and even some days in which I did the problems after a 16 hour shift.

I eventually reached my limit from fatigue and was forced to retire from continuing AoC for the year... though I am not too sure how long I would have lasted past day 14.
