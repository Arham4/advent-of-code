## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz). Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at midnight (EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!

## AoC 2020 Progress

2020 was a quite the challenge for my schedule. I started working at a COVID-19 lab in November and had very taxing hours. There were some days I did the AoC at work and even some days in which I did the problems after a 16 hour shift.

I eventually reached my limit from fatigue and was forced to retire from continuing AoC for the year... though I am not too sure how long I would have lasted past day 14.
